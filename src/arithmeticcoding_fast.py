# Arithmetic coding (AC) is a form of entropy encoding used in lossless data compression. Normally, a string of characters is represented using a fixed number of bits per character, as in the ASCII code. When a string is converted to arithmetic encoding, frequently used characters will be stored with fewer bits and not-so-frequently occurring characters will be stored with more bits, resulting in fewer bits used in total. Arithmetic coding differs from other forms of entropy encoding, such as Huffman coding, in that rather than separating the input into component symbols and replacing each with a code, arithmetic coding encodes the entire message into a single number, an arbitrary-precision fraction q, where 0.0 ≤ q < 1.0. It represents the current information as a range, defined by two numbers.[1] A recent family of entropy coders called asymmetric numeral systems allows for faster implementations thanks to directly operating on a single natural number representing the current information.[2]

		#   and they reduce the approximation error inherent in adapting fractions to integers;
		#   both effects reduce the data encoding loss and asymptotically approach the efficiency
		#   of arithmetic coding using exact fractions.
		# - But larger state sizes increase the computation time for integer arithmetic,
		#   and compression gains beyond ~30 bits essentially zero in real-world applications.
		# - Python has native bigint arithmetic, so there is no upper limit to the state size.
