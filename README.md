# Comparative Analysis of Traditional and AI-Based Lossless Data Compression Methods
## Project Overview
This research project conducts a comprehensive comparison between traditional lossless compression algorithms and modern artificial intelligence-based compression methods. Our primary goal is to evaluate and analyze the performance characteristics of both approaches across different types of data, focusing on compression ratios, computational requirements, and processing times.
## Motivation
The emergence of AI-based compression techniques has opened new possibilities in data compression, but their practical applicability remains a subject of investigation. This project aims to:

* Compare the effectiveness of traditional and AI-based compression methods
* Analyze the computational resources required for both approaches
* Evaluate compression and decompression times
* Investigate the feasibility of AI-based compression on hardware with limited capabilities
* Propose optimization strategies for resource-constrained environments

## Technical Architecture
The application follows a modular architecture consisting of three main components:

1. Frontend Interface:

  * Handles file input/output operations
  * Provides user interaction for compression/decompression tasks
  * Displays performance metrics and results


2. Compression Module:

  * Implements both traditional and AI-based compression methods
  * Utilizes neural network models for AI-based compression
  * Generates metadata and weight files for compressed data
  * Incorporates arithmetic coding for final compression stage


3. Decompression Module:

  * Handles reconstruction of original data
  * Processes compressed files and associated metadata
  * Implements inverse arithmetic coding
  * Uses trained models for AI-based decompression



## Implementation Details
The AI-based compression approach utilizes:

* Binary data reading for input processing
* Neural network models for sequence prediction
* Arithmetic coding for probability distribution encoding
* Metadata generation and management
* Symmetric compression/decompression operations

## Hardware Considerations
* The project specifically addresses hardware limitations by:

## Analyzing GPU dependency for neural network computations
* Investigating CPU-only execution possibilities
* Proposing optimization strategies for resource-constrained environments
* Evaluating performance trade-offs on different hardware configurations
